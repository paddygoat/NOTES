orbitty/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra/

Change to the Linux_for_Tegra_tx2 directory:

cd /home/tegwyn/Desktop/Orbitty/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra

Extract the BSP:

tar -xzf CTI-L4T-V121.tgz

Run the install script (as root or sudo) to automatically install the BSP files to the correct locations on the host system:

cd /home/tegwyn/Desktop/Orbitty/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra/CTI-L4T
sudo ./install.sh

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Internet and ethernet MUST be working simultaneously on TX2 - test this works.
On TX2, select new connection, then Method = 'shared to other computers' and Device = eth0. Nothing else to change or add. Internet does not have to work on host.

Use $ ifconfig on TX2 to find auto assigned IP address and gateway. (Gateway = Mask).NB. It does change!

Example:
ethernet:  169.254.140.154 .... On TX2
ethernet:  169.254.140.155 .... On host ..... NB last digit is different.
ethernet:  169.254.140.154 .... In host check box
